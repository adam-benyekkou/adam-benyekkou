<br>


I am a **Senior Support Specialist** transitioning into a dual **Junior Developer & DevOps** role. I bridge the gap between clean, scalable code and resilient, automated infrastructure.


I "Build in Public" on my blog, documenting technical deep-dives into cloud architecture and the philosophy of modern engineering.

## Philosophy

> "To create is to exist. Code that serves no purpose perishes. Humans differ from machines by their ability to evolve beyond their designed purpose."

Growing wiser, one commit at a time.
